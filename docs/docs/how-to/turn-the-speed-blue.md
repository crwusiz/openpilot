# Turn the speed blue
*A getting started guide for openpilot development*

In 30 minutes, we'll get an openpilot development environment setup on your computer and make some changes to openpilot's UI.

And if you have a comma 3/3X, we'll deploy the change to your device for testing.

## 1. Setup your development environment

Run this to clone openpilot and install all the dependencies:
```bash
curl -fsSL openpilot.comma.ai | bash
```

Then, compile openpilot:
```bash
cd openpilot
scons -j8
```

## 2. Run replay

We'll run the `replay` tool with the demo route to get data streaming for testing our UI changes.
```bash
# in terminal 1
tools/replay/replay --demo

# in terminal 2
selfdrive/ui/ui
```

The openpilot UI should launch and show a replay of the demo route.

If you have your own comma device, you can replace `--demo` with one of your own routes from comma connect.

## 3. Make the speed blue

Search for “mph” with git grep in the `ui` folder.
```bash
$ git grep "mph" selfdrive/ui/
paint.cc:  ui_draw_text(s, s->fb_w/2, 290, s->scene.is_metric ? "km/h" : "mph", 36 * 2.5, COLOR_WHITE_ALPHA(200), "sans-regular");
```

The line right above contains the actual speed. Unfortunately, COLOR_BLUE isn’t defined, but a git grep of COLOR_WHITE shows it’s nvgRGBA(255, 255, 255, 255). Personally, I like a lighter blue, so I went with #8080FF.
```bash
$ git diff
diff --git a/selfdrive/ui/paint.cc b/selfdrive/ui/paint.cc

## 4. Rebuild UI, and admire your work

```
scons -j8 && selfdrive/ui/ui
```

## 5. Push your fork to GitHub

Click fork on GitHub. Then, push with:
```bash
git remote rm origin
git remote add origin git@github.com:<your-github-username>/openpilot.git
git add .
git commit -m "Make the speed blue."
git push --set-upstream origin master
```

### 6. Run your fork on device in your car!

Uninstall openpilot from your device through the settings. Then, enter the URL for your very own installer:
```
installer.comma.ai/<your-github-username>/master
```

### 7. Admire your work IRL
