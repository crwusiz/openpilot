Using openpilot in a car
------

To use openpilot in a car, you need four things:
1. **Supported Device:** a comma four, available at [comma.ai/shop/comma-four](https://www.comma.ai/shop/comma-four).
2. **Software:** The setup procedure for the comma four allows users to enter a URL for custom software. Use the URL `openpilot.comma.ai` to install the release version.
3. **Supported Car:** Ensure that you have one of [the 300+ supported cars](docs/CARS.md).
4. **Car Harness:** You will also need a [car harness](https://comma.ai/shop/car-harness) to connect your comma four to your car.

We have detailed instructions for [how to install the harness and device in a car](https://comma.ai/setup). Note that it's possible to run openpilot on [other hardware](https://blog.comma.ai/self-driving-car-for-free/), although it's not plug-and-play.


### Branches

Running `master` and other branches directly is supported, but it's recommended to run one of the following prebuilt branches:

| comma four branch      | comma 3X branch        | URL                                    | description                                                                         |
|------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `release-mici`         | `release-tizi`         | openpilot.comma.ai                     | This is openpilot's release branch.                                                 |
| `release-mici-staging` | `release-tizi-staging` | openpilot-test.comma.ai                | This is the staging branch for releases. Use it to get new releases slightly early. |
| `nightly`              | `nightly`              | openpilot-nightly.comma.ai             | This is the bleeding edge development branch. Do not expect this to be stable.      |
| `nightly-dev`          | `nightly-dev`          | installer.comma.ai/commaai/nightly-dev | Same as nightly, but includes experimental development features for some cars.      |

For [chestnut](https://comma.ai/shop/chestnut), use the following installer URLs:

| branch                       | URL                                                        | description                                                                         |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `release-chestnut`           | installer.comma.ai/commaai/release-chestnut                | This is openpilot's release branch.                                                 |
| `release-chestnut-staging`   | installer.comma.ai/commaai/release-chestnut-staging        | This is the staging branch for releases. Use it to get new releases slightly early. |
| `nightly-chestnut`           | installer.comma.ai/commaai/nightly-chestnut                | This is the bleeding edge development branch. Do not expect this to be stable.      |
| `nightly-chestnut-dev`       | installer.comma.ai/commaai/nightly-chestnut-dev            | Same as nightly, but includes experimental development features for some cars.      |

Safety and Testing
----

* openpilot observes [ISO26262](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_26262) guidelines, see [SAFETY.md](docs/SAFETY.md) for more details.
* openpilot has software-in-the-loop [tests](.github/workflows/tests.yaml) that run on every commit.
* The code enforcing the safety model lives in panda and is written in C, see [code rigor](https://github.com/commaai/panda#code-rigor) for more details.
* panda has software-in-the-loop [safety tests](https://github.com/commaai/panda/tree/master/tests/safety).
* Internally, we have a hardware-in-the-loop Jenkins test suite that builds and unit tests the various processes.
* panda has additional hardware-in-the-loop [tests](https://github.com/commaai/panda/blob/master/Jenkinsfile).
* We run the latest openpilot in a testing closet containing 10 comma devices continuously replaying routes.
